title: "Different vitamins and their functions"
---
- **Fat-Soluble Vitamins**
  - These are stored in body fat, so overdose causes toxicity.
  - **Vitamin A**
    - Essential for vision, immune function, and skin health. 
    - Comes in forms like 
      - retinol (from animal sources): Fish oils, milk, egg
      - and beta-carotene (from plant sources): leafy greens, orange and yellow vegtables (carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin and other winter squash, summer squash) & fruits (cantaloupe, mango), Tomatoes, red bell pepper
  - **Vitamin D**
    - Important for bone health, immune function, and calcium absorption. Different forms include:
      - **D2 (Ergocalciferol)**
        - Mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light
        - Less potent and effective than D3
      - **D3 (Cholecalciferol)**
        - Produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight
        - found in animal-based foods: Fatty Fish, such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines; Egg yolks
  - **Vitamin E**
    - Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Includes various tocopherols and tocotrienols.
    - found in plant-based oils, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables.
  - **Vitamin K**
    - Essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism. Types include:
      - **K1 (Phylloquinone)**
        - found primarily in green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale, and broccoli.
        - primarily involved in blood clotting
      - **K2 (Menaquinone)**
        - mainly involved in bone and cardiovascular health.
        - helps to regulate calcium deposition, promoting the calcification of bones while preventing the calcification of blood vessels and kidneys.
        - found in some fermented foods, animal products, and is also produced by gut bacteria.

- **Water-Soluble Vitamins**
  - **B Vitamins**
    - A complex of vitamins crucial in energy metabolism, brain function, and red blood cell production.
    - **B1 (Thiamine)**
      - Important for energy metabolism and nerve function.
    - **B2 (Riboflavin)**
      - Plays a role in energy production, skin health, and vision.
    - **B3 (Niacin)**
      - Involved in DNA repair, metabolism, and skin health.
    - **B5 (Pantothenic Acid)**
      - Essential for fatty acid synthesis and energy production.
    - **B6 (Pyridoxine)**
      - Important in amino acid metabolism, red blood cell production, and neurotransmitter synthesis.
    - **B7 (Biotin)**
      - Key for hair, skin, and nail health, as well as macronutrient metabolism.
    - **B9 (Folate or Folic Acid)**
      - Vital for DNA synthesis and repair, particularly important during pregnancy.
    - **B12 (Cobalamin)**
      - Essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
  - **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)**
    - Important for collagen synthesis, antioxidant defense, immune function, and enhancing iron absorption from plant-based foods.
