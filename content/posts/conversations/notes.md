## How to not be boring in conversations

### Handle short answer questions
- Don't answer a question with short answers, it puts pressure on the other person to keep the conversation going. 
- Instead expand on the question, share enough to make the conversation easy for the other person, but then create space for them to speak.
  - Example - wrong:
    - Other: "How was your day?"
    - You: "Good."
  - Example - right:
    - Other: "How was your day?"
    - You: "It was great, I went for a walk and you won't believe what I saw..."
    - Other: "What? What is it?"

### Cold start a conversation (avoid energy ducking)
- People tend to be sensitive and judgemental when start talking with a stranger. 
- Try to initiate playfulness and light-hearted to make a positive impression, and keep conversation relaxing and enjoyable. 
- Most people want to have fun and funny conversations, they just aren't sure how to start.
- You can try to act funny or say something funny, or answer the first question with something absurd or funny.
  - Example:
    - Other: "How was your day?"
    - You: "You know just another day converting coffee into code, then catching bugs that I accidently put in there in the first place."
  - Example 2:
    - Other: "Belgium is everything bad for you, fries, waffles, chocolate..."
    - You: "Black tar heroin?"
    - Other laughs "black tar heroin, they still got that at the back of a food truck now..."
    - You: "And vending machines... You know, theres chocolate, black tar heroin, ..."

### Assuming Interest
- Hint at something that the other person would be interested and be curious about what you have to say (like the ending of a story).


### Ask interesting questions
- if you want to ask questions that people wants to answer, ask unique questions that they haven't heard before, not the same old boring questions. (like questions unique to their life experience or what they have learned from it)
- You can also ask hypothetical questions, like if you were the president what would you do with ... ? These questions are good because they let people express their values without risking expose their own potential boring life.


### Dont be a passive listener
- You can choose to mirroring, or paraphrasing.
- Find reasons to laugh (not faking though), or be surprised, even if it might be small. (it make the other person to feel funny and open up)
  

## How to handle awkward situations
- Expand (instead of shrink) in awkward situations.
  - Shrink: get quiet, look down, and try to disappear.
  - Expand: get louder, laugh, and be more expressive. Also call yourself out and maybe find humor in it.
  - when you are scared or stressed express your feelings (with a smile or laugh of course) relaxes yourself and others.
  - Body language matters more than words
  - smile before you dial (smile primes yourself in a better emotional state, which others can sense)
  - Try to avoid em or ahh, instead use silence which make you seem more thoughtful and confident. Dont look down, side or up is ok.
