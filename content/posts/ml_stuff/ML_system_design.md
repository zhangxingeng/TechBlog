### Overview of ML System Design Structure

1. Assumptions

2. Problem Exploration
   - a Problem as ML optimization objective
   - b What does success look like? Business/Online metrics

3. Model Building
   - a Training data generation
   - b Feature engineering
   - c Models and evaluation metrics

4. Deployment
   - a A/B experiments
   - b Model debugging - offline vs. online metric differences
   - c Model versioning, monitoring, and maintenance
   - d Rare event effects - cold starts, novelty effect, popularity bias, explore vs. exploit, training feedback loops
