title: "My Thoughts about the Future" 
---


help me write a prediction about the future message, something like this (I will give you the rough structure and you fill in the details, especially places I would mark with a question mark) try to matain my simple words but fix syntax issues and thing that did not express well. dont be verbose, be precise
In the near future, if not now, junior jobs, especially those dealing with a lot of documents / codes (? be specific, like engineering, accounting, legal, you need to add more) would be less and less, while senior jobs gets a higher salary since most junior jobs can be done, often better by generative AIs. 

while at the same time, jobs like researching would start to boom because getting enough knowledge to be able to contribute to the state of the art science wont be as difficult and people would naturally diverge from labor intensive jobs (which are being replaced by AIs) toward wisdom / insight oriented jobs. Of course research will continue to adapt to use AI / ML as their aiding tool for prof of concept, but still the ideas need some human touch. 

action labor jobs is a completely different story: service jobs (like restaurant servers) are harder to be replaced since we as human still enjoy humanly interactions (it really depend on each indivdual )
