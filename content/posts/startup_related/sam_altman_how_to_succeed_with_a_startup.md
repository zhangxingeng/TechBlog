- If you can build a product so good that people spontinously tell their friends about it you have done 80% of the work.
- If you can't explain in a few words, its not good enough
- identify potential exponential growth in market, and ride that up elevator
- Identify real trends from fake ones
  - Real trends: new-tech platform comes along, early adopters uses it obsessively, and tell their friends about it
    - e.g. Iphone
  - Fake trends: people may buy the product but don't use it
    - e.g. VR

  - Optimists: You need to be optimal when the world continues to punch you in the face

  - Ive got it: You need people who takes thing up
  - Win by moving quickly: never enough data
  - the blessing of inexperience: many best things come from no experience
- Momentum: never lose momentum - if you have it people keep developing if you lose it its hard to get it back
    - up to the founders to make sure (no work balance for founders)
