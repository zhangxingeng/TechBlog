### Salary Negotiation

  - reiterate your desired salray
  - "it seems like..." labeling the feeling
  - make sure other person feel heard
  - acknowledge their point and feeling even dont agree
  - Address objections like "You might think ... but ..."
  - use "HOW" and "WHAT" to avoid other person become defensive

  - Use SILENCE after a request, put pressue on other side
  
- Examples:
Interviewer: 
"We are offering 80,000 for this position."

You: 
"Thank you for the offer. It sounds like the role is really exciting and aligns well with my career goals. Based on my research and the market rates for someone with my experience and skills, I was expecting something closer to 90,000. How can we bridge this gap?"

Interviewer: 
"Thank you for sharing your perspective and for highlighting your valuable skills and experience. However, our budget for this position is firmly set at 80,000 due to company-wide salary structures and budget constraints for this fiscal year. Unfortunately, we are unable to go beyond this amount. How do you feel about this offer, considering our constraints?"

You:
"Thank you for explaining the budget constraints. It sounds like the 80,000 salary is a fixed limit due to current company-wide policies and budget restrictions. I understand these limitations, but considering my extensive experience and the unique skills I bring to the table, such as [specific skills or achievements], I believe there is significant value I can add to the team.
**How can we find a way to make this work given these constraints?**"

1. Tactical Empathy and Labeling:
"Thank you for being straightforward about the budget constraints. It sounds like there's very little room for flexibility, and I understand how challenging budget restrictions can be for a company."

1. Calibrated Questions:
"How can we ensure that my compensation reflects the value I bring to the team, given the fixed budget? What steps can we take to bridge the gap between my expectations and the current offer?"

1. Accusation Audit:
"I understand you might feel I'm being persistent, but it's important for me to ensure that the compensation reflects my market value and the expertise I bring.

1. Mirroring:

"Fixed limit? So, is there absolutely no flexibility, even for someone with a unique skill set and extensive experience like mine?"

5. Creating the Illusion of Control:

"I want to ensure that both of us are satisfied with the agreement. What would you suggest as a fair way to reconsider the base salary while staying within the company's constraints?"
