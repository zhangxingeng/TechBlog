###
- Everything is based on the fact that light speed is constant and will not change regardless.
- [What would we see at the speed of light?](https://youtu.be/vFNgd3pitAI?si=Qbf2jh_dqWh1KWCC)
- This video explains how light changes in 3D space when near light speed very informative.

### How time dialation connects with the speed of light
- imagine time and space are both real things like atoms not just space and time.
- time travels like light travels and time passes at a given place when time as a particle hits it
- The more time hits you the faster time is for you.
- now again time have a constant speed and if you travel near its speed, you get less and less time hitting you -- wich means slower time for you!
- Same goes for photons, faster you are, less particle hits you, less light you perceive (see the youtube video how it looks like)
- Imagine rain fall, the faster you move less rain would hit you.

### How things strech when observed at near light speed
- things would seem elongated in the direction of motion
- when you reach speed of light you would be seen as a line (or we could call it "wave") from origin to destination. For observers you are traveling at c, for you anywhere is instant.
- This means if you can travel at speed of light you can go to 1 million years away / 1 millon years later in an instant. However for people on earth 1 million years would have passed.
- Imagine how super-sonic jets, if you sound does not decay, you should be able to talk and cant hear youself. but then you stop, you can hear your voice from before! this is what would happen if a person can travel faster than speed of light: you would go back in time because time cant catch up with you. (if talking on a super-sonic jet is considered "present", then hearing yourself later is you experiencing the past)
- This is why einstein says nothing can travel faster than light, because if it does we can communicate with the past (which never happens, unless it does one day, we assume its true. Like we assume gravity is constant, unless one day it disappears)
- This is also why light is a particle but also a wave -- when particle travel at light speed its stretched to a wave.
