# Common ML interview questions and my answers
- [ref](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/machine-learning-interview-questions)
## Basic ML Questions
- What is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?
  - supervised learning needs labels like classifying images or recognize objects from images
  - unsupervised learning have no labels, it extracts patterns from data itself like clustering, or dimensionality reduction
- What are the different types of machine learning?
  - Sup and Unsup (previous question) and Reinforcement learning
  - RL involves punishment and reward of an agent, mostly used for robotics
- What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms?
  - "Deep": when a model relies on the complexity of the depth of the model to solve a non-trivial problem, its considered as deep learning
- What are the differences between machine learning and deep learning?
  - They are closely related and DL is a subset of ML
  - Anything that have a self optimization process purely from data can be considered as ML
  - While only when depth of layers is relied upon to solve a problem, its considered as DL
- Explain the confusion matrix with respect to machine learning algorithms.
  - TP
- What is the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning?
- What’s the trade-off between bias and variance?
- Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.
- What’s your favorite algorithm, and can you explain it to me in less than a minute?
- How is KNN different from k-means clustering?
- What is cross validation and what are different methods of using it?
- Explain how a ROC curve works.
- What’s the difference between probability and likelihood?
- What’s the difference between a generative and discriminative model?
- How is a decision tree pruned?
- How can you choose a classifier based on a training set size?
- What methods for dimensionality reduction do you know and how do they compare with each other?
- Define precision and recall.
- What’s a Fourier transform?
- What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?
- When should you use classification over regression?
- How would you evaluate a logistic regression model?
- What is Bayes’ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context?
- Describe a hash table.
