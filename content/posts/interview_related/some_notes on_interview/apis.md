- Design Principles of RESTful (representational state transfer) APIs
  1. Statelessness
  2. uniform interface (all clients (e.g. web, mobile) access should be same)
  3. client server speration of job
  4. cacheable: explicitely indicate if response can be cached
1. API design
   - use api versioning
   - use limit like pagination
   - handle async 
   - logging and monitoring
