title: "Going back to my 3d Teeth generating project"
---

Its been a while since I worked on my mesh generation projects. I need to go back to the begining for it to make sense.

Last year October my professor recommended me a PhD student of his to help me in starting my research career -- basically I want to dig deep in ML specifically Transformers but I am not sure where to start, So I talked with my professor and he agreed to help.
My guide, the PhD student, is a really nice person. She told me she is working on a 3D mesh generating model, specifically using transformer to regenerate missing mesh from 3D scans of patient tooth. I was really excited and decided to engage. She is a really helpful person and is willing to guide me through whenever I got questions, however she has been busy -- first graduation then finding new job then fitting into a new university where he just found a job -- and I havent been the best student -- when she is busy I just slacked -- and I have wasted so much time. The project has been going, and I have implemented some features:
    - read the entire dataset
    - convert mesh into point cloud
    - downsample pointcloud (decimate) using KNN
    - convert point clouds into a dataset
However, What I am struggling to to is: rewrite other people's code and adapt our dataset to their code so we could have a baseline. She recommended me some papers to read and I have read them and I have a rough idea of what to do next. But somehow I just feel lazy and want to procrastinate. I know if I dedicate my time into it I will be able to do it but I just wont.

Now it come to today. I have decided to stop wasting my time and start to actually work on the project:
    1. I need to read the code she asked me to read last time details are here: (https://hackmd.io/Hj5DCYo5QPawJ50-KuVQPQ)
    2. finish my SOP for PhD application
    3. Schedule a meeting with her and talk about my situation
